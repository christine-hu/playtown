# Playtown!

“Playtown!” is a web game for kids to discover and personalize their own world. The game begins with a town map, and users can complete different activities at different locations. Players will be able to: 
- create a robot,
- customize an avatar,
- build an ice cream sundae, and
- design a house!

All controls are switch-accessible, and users can also adjust text size and scroll speed. Design-wise, Playtown aims to follow the [Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/index.html) and the [Game Accessibility Guidelines](http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/full-list/).


On the technical side, the game is being built with:
- HTML, JavaScript, & CSS (Using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game engine)
- [Assembly](http://assemblyapp.co/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/en/), & [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (Sprite creation)
