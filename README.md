# Playtown!

“Playtown!” is a web game for kids to discover and personalize their own world. Users start by customizing their own character, choosing from different hairstyles, skin colors, and clothing items. The character can then explore the town map, which has three locations: a transportation workshop, an arcade, and an ice cream shop.

Players will be able to:
- design a vehicle of choice at the transportation workshop (including sailboats or rocket ships!)
- play simple games at the arcade
- build their dream sundae at the ice cream shop

All controls will be fully switch-accessible, and users can choose their own contrast, text size, and difficulty preferences.
